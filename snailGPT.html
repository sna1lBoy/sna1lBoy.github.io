    <h1> snailGPT </h1>
    <h2> big AI has had us fooled this entire time! LLMs don't need weights or models to generate text! have you seen chatGPT lifting weights at the gym? no! of course not! have you seen grok modeling on the cover of magazines? nope! and don't even get me started on these so called pArAmEtErs, if that's even their real name! parameters aren't real! have you ever heard of a parameter before bard invented it? hell no! so that's why i'm introducing snailGPT! a local LLM without all that corporate propaganda! </h2>
